About me

I am a highly skilled and experienced software engineer with a passion for developing innovative and user-friendly applications. I have a strong understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. I am also proficient in a variety of programming languages and technologies, including Python, Django, C++, React Native, MySQL, VS Code, and Firebase.

In my current role as a Software Developer at DataBalk, I work on full-stack projects in React JS and C#. I also work in a team using React JS as a front-ender and C# as a back-ender, as well as Power Pages and Power Apps projects.

In my previous role as an Interning Junior Web Developer at Youngling Africa, I was responsible for developing and maintaining a variety of web applications. I also worked on a team to develop a new mobile app using React Native. I have a proven track record of success in delivering high-quality software on time and within budget.

I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a strong work ethic. I am also a team player and I am always willing to help others.

Basically, I am an IT geek 😆
